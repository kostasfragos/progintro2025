# progintro2025
## This repo contains the solution to every single exercise of the course "progintro" of the season 2025-2026 in NTUA.

- Some of the ".cpp" files use "pzhelp" to make the code simpler. If you wanna download and run them: download the file "pzhelp", remove the extension (if it has one) and place it in the folder your ".cpp" files are in.

- The problem statements for all the set of exercises except the 7th one can be read as ".pdf" files in the [Εκφωνήσεις](https://github.com/kostasfragos/progintro2025/tree/main/%CE%95%CE%BA%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82) folder.

- In the [useful_programs](https://github.com/kostasfragos/progintro2025/tree/main/useful_programs) folder you can find some common algorithm implementations that might help you throughout the course.

- In the [Παλιά Θέματα](https://github.com/kostasfragos/progintro2025/tree/main/%CE%A0%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%AC%20%CE%98%CE%AD%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B1) folder you can find the implementations of some programs in old exams (whose statements can be found in the same folder) in order to find the answer directly by downloading and running them and not having to "run them by hand". **Make sure you place the file "pzhelp" in the same folder your ".cpp" files are in, in order to run them properly** (e.g., in the folder "ΚΑΝ2025").
