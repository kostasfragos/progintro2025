# progintro2025
## This repo contains the solution to every single exercise of the course "progintro" of the season 2025-2026 in NTUA.

- Some of the ".cpp" files use "pzhelp" to make the code simpler. If you wanna download and run them: download the "pzhelp" file, remove the extension (if it has one) and place it in the folder your ".cpp" files are in.

- The problem statements for all the set of exercises except the 7th one can be read as ".pdf" files in the [Εκφωνήσεις](https://github.com/kostasfragos/progintro2025/tree/main/%CE%95%CE%BA%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82) folder.

- In the [useful_programs](https://github.com/kostasfragos/progintro2025/tree/main/useful_programs) folder you can find some common algorithm implementations that might help you throughout the course.
