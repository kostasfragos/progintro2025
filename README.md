# progintro
## In this repo, I will be applauding every single exercise of the course "progintro" in NTUA.

Some of the files use "pzhelp" to make the code simpler. If you wanna download and run the files you will first need to remove the extension of the "pzhelp" file (if it has one) and place it in the folder your ".cpp" files are in.
