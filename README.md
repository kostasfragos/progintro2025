# progintro2025
## In this repo, I will be uploading every single exercise of the course "progintro" of the season 2025-2026 in NTUA.

Some of the files use "pzhelp" to make the code simpler. If you wanna download and run the files you will first need to remove the extension of the "pzhelp" file (if it has one) and place it in the folder your ".cpp" files are in.

The problem statements for all the set of exercises except the 7th one can be read as .pdf files in the [Εκφωνήσεις](https://github.com/kostasfragos/progintro2025/tree/main/%CE%95%CE%BA%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82) folder.

In the [useful_programs](https://github.com/kostasfragos/progintro2025/tree/main/useful_programs) folder you can find some common algorithm implementations that might help you throughout the course.
