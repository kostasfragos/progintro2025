# progintro2025
## In this repo, I will be uploading every single exercise of the course "progintro" of the year 2025 in NTUA.

Some of the files use "pzhelp" to make the code simpler. If you wanna download and run the files you will first need to remove the extension of the "pzhelp" file (if it has one) and place it in the folder your ".cpp" files are in.

In the ["useful_programs"](https://github.com/kostasfragos/progintro2025/tree/main/useful_programs) folder you can find some common algorithm implemantations that might help you throughout the course.
